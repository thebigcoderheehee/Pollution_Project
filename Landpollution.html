    <h1>Land Pollution</h1>
    <img src="https://www.youthvoices.live/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/landpollution.jpg">
    <p>Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of
        xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by
        industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved
        are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene),
        solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of
        industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from
        health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary
        contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil. Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the
        resulting clean ups are time-consuming and expensive tasks, and require expertise in geology, hydrology,
        chemistry, computer modelling, and GIS in Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history
        of industrial chemistry.

        In North America and Western Europe the extent of contaminated land is best known, with many of countries in
        these areas having a legal framework to identify and deal with this environmental problem. Developing countries
        tend to be less tightly regulated despite some of them having undergone significant industrialization.</p>
