    <h1>Water pollution</h1>
    <img height="700px" src="https://sites.stedwards.edu/bluevelvet/files/2019/02/pollution-2cnp54r.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their
        uses. It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers,
        reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants
        can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural
        activities, and urban runoff including stormwater. Water pollution may affect either surface water or
        groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems.
        Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Water
        pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.

        Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable
        cause, such as a storm drain, a wastewater treatment plant or an oil spill. Non-point sources are more diffuse.
        An example is agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Pollution may
        take many forms. One would is toxic substances such as oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent organic
        pollutants, and industrial waste products. Another is stressful conditions such as changes of pH, hypoxia or
        anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive turbidity, or changes of salinity. The introduction of pathogenic
        organisms is another. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. A common cause of thermal
        pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers.

        Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans as well as legislation.
        Technology solutions can include improving sanitation, sewage treatment, industrial wastewater treatment,
        agricultural wastewater treatment, erosion control, sediment control and control of urban runoff (including
        stormwater management).

        Definition
        A practical definition of water pollution is: "Water pollution is the addition of substances or energy forms
        that directly or indirectly alter the nature of the water body in such a manner that negatively affects its
        legitimate uses. "Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants.
        Due to these contaminants, it either no longer supports a certain human use, such as drinking water, or
        undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish.</p>
